Leo, a neat and clean theme to showcase all your work.

* Full Bootstrap Power, seamlessly integrated in Automattic's starter theme _s to bring these two together the cleanest way.
* Multi leve dropdown support for Bootstrap navigation.
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* Schema.org markup 
* RTL support
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `includes/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `includes/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `includes/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in `js/keyboard-navigation.js`. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv3 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
